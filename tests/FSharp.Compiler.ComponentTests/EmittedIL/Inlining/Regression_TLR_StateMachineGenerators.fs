/// Purpose: cover sequence / task / async state-machine generators declared as members of
/// GENERIC classes. Each generator compiles to a nested state-machine type; class tyvars
/// must be threaded into that generated type correctly and the state machine must stay
/// scoped inside its declaring class (never a module sibling), which is the same scope
/// rule the closures in Regression_RealsigAugmentationClosure.fs enforce.
///
/// Existing coverage is limited to seq/task/async in NON-generic augmentation members
/// (#19955); generic-class members (body-declared AND generic methods) are the gap here.
///
/// Variant policy: runtime = 4-way matrix; IL = realsig +/- under --optimize+ only (the
/// nested-state-machine token is an optimize+ codegen artifact). No IL baselines are
/// generated; the nested/absent fragment pairs below pin only the *scope*, which is the
/// invariant that matters.
